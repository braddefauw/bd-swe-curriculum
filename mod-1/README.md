## Agile Development Plan

#### 1.1.1 Agile Development
* Opportunity: A social care company provides home-based health care for the elderly. The pool of carers work in shifts and visit properties in pairs. A care package includes 3 visits each day; morning, afternoon and evening, 7 days a week. At present, the central office draws up lists on a spreadsheet and, as carers visit a property, they sign in and out on a sheet of paper that is collected at the end of the week and used to invoice clients. Sometimes the signing sheet is lost or not handed in. Also carers can be delayed at some properties and this has caused some heated complaints from those expecting carers who then arrive late. Can you help this company be more efficient?

#### 1.1.2 Personas
##### Persona #1
* Sarah is a secretary who is in charge of collecting data for the social care company.
* Needs: to have a well-functioning system to store data
* Frustrations: signing sheet is sometimes lost or not handed in, losing data

##### Persona #2
* Jim is a recipient of care from the social care company.
* Needs: to have a carer arrive on time daily, as his medication is needed on time
* Frustrations: sometimes carers are late

##### Persona #3
* Hailey is a nurse for the home-based health care company.
* Needs: to know where she is going and when, and to be able to log her hours
* Frustrations: sheets are sometime lost, paper sheets make it difficult to access information from home
